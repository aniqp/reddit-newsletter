I'm a student in the tenth grade from Saskatoon. I fell in love with Waterloo when I watched campus tours and showcases from the its robotics team. Not to mention its hackatons and builder spaces and it's generally very intellectually stimulating culture. I would really, really like to get into the Waterloo CS program.\n\nHowever, I'm really unsure about my prospects. Academically I do ok, but not particularly exceptional (last semester I got a 96% total average). On the extra curricular side I play piano and I also really love programming so I work on hobby or open source projects when I can. However I really don't think that's good enough, since I'm pretty mid at both. What else could I do? There frankly isn't much to do in Saskatoon -- tech scene is nonexistent, so no internships or camps. I've been thinking of joining clubs at school, doing sports or volunteering, but would that make any difference? People always say that you should highlight what your passionate about, not do things for the sake of looking good, but what do you do when what your passionate about doesn't seem good enough?\n\nAlso, I heard that Waterloo adjusts applicants averages based on what high school they went to but I'm not sure how that would play out, given how nobody from my school has went to Waterloo before. My parents also made me go to a religious high school, although I'm not religious myself, so I'm not sure how that would make me seem.\n\nI don't know, I'll probably be rejected,  but maybe you could give me advice on how to start trying.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Very grateful for the quick responses! I'll try my hand at some competitions and look into sports.","comments":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"children":[{"data":{"body":"Grade 10?\n\nMan just enjoy yourself, they only care about your grade 11 \u0026amp; 12 marks, ( and they really don‚Äôt care about 11 that much)\n\nI would just say, grab some EC‚Äôs, Sports, anything that would look pretty good on your resume. \n\nFor CS specifically, I would try your absolute best on the Waterloo CS \u0026amp; Math Contests, as they are actually important to your admission decision as far as I‚Äôm concerned."}},{"data":{"body":"Control what you can. Continue to get good grades, do extra curriculars, keep doing Math/CS related work like projects, schools, competitions. Prioritize maintaining good grades and look out for competitions in CS like CCC or anything you see people mentioning often in this sub, and then once you're gr.11/12 focus on your AIF.
